## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS DOM manipulation

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to use the forEach() method to iterate over the list of rating buttons. By doing this in a few different ways, I was able to add a selection class after a click, clear any DOM-added classes when you click off a button to remove your selection, and pull the value to add to the thank you card.

### Continued development

I need to continue learning and practicing JavaScript. I was able to talk out my process with pseudo-coding. The execution of this needs a little refinement from me. This will come with continued practice.
